                After doing some reading on SovTech, I believe that their entire direction as company is the perfect fit for me.
                Creating custom software based on the needs of a customer using different technologies sounds like an excitong challenge.
                I believe working at SovTech will help me grow because 
                I'll be constantly learing from industry experts as well as showing what I've got too. This is an opportunity that I will grab with both hands 
                and prove my worth from day one.
